# Yafai Skills ðŸš€

## Yafai Skills is the Tools Framework for YAFAI Agents

YAFAI Skills provides a robust framework designed to extend the capabilities of YAFAI agents. By integrating this toolset, you can enhance the functionality of your YAFAI agents with custom skills and tools, leveraging gRPC for high-performance interactions.

### Description

YAFAI skills is the tools framework that enables you to build and integrate new skills into your YAFAI agents. It empowers your agents with more advanced abilities, improving their performance and adaptability.

### Features

- **REST API based**: Seamlessly integrates with RESTful APIs for ease of use and compatibility.
- **Authentication support**: Implements API token-based authentication, with the ability to piggyback on existing RBAC systems for enhanced security.

### Installation

To install YAFAI Skills, you can easily use Homebrew. Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
brew tap yafai-hub/yafai
brew install yafai-skill
```

### Parameters to Skill Engine
To start the Skill Engine with the necessary configurations, you can run the binary with the following parameters:

```bash
// Run the skill engine with the below params
yafai-skill -m [manifest file path] -k [api key for the service]
yafai-skill -h // for help on parameters
```


### Skill Manifest File
The skill manifest file is the central configuration point for defining your skill server. Below is an example of a v0.0.1 version of the manifest file:

```yaml

name: ServiceName
description: YAFAI skills for ServiceName
actions:
  Action1:
    desc: Action Description
    base_url: Service URL with placeholders (e.g., service.com/{url_path}/{query_param})
    method: POST
    params:
      - {name: test-param1, type: string, in: path, desc: "Param1.", required: true}
      - {name: test-param2, type: string, in: query, desc: "Param2.", required: true}
      - {name: test-param3, type: string, in: body, desc: "Param3", required: true}
    response_template: # Golang text templates for preparing responses
      success: "Completed action with {{.response}}'"
      failure: "Failed to complete action: {{.Error}}"
```
Pre-built Manifests Coming Soon!!

Stay tuned for more pre-built manifests that you can use out-of-the-box to quickly deploy skills into your YAFAI agents.
